# Create a printer friendly version of a README.md

In some cases likes workshops, classrooms, etc it can be helpful to have a printout of the readme. However, tyipcal formatting of items like URLs would make printouts of typical README files less useful. This tool will add information to the README to make it more useful as a printout, though less asthetically pleasing overall.

## Usage

- CD to the directory with the desired README.md
- `npx printer-friendly-readme`

A new file named README_PRINTER_FRIENDLY.md will be created

## Demo

![Demo](./doc/demo.png 'Demo')
